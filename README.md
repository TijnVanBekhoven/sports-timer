# Welcome to Sports Timer 👋

This is an app I have created so others and I can start a new sport 
without overexerting ourselves too much.
In case you would like to make changes to the app go ahead,
but don't expect the code to be amazing. 
The project is bodged ``🗣 /bɒdʒd/`` together in a few days.
Aside from me wanting to start running, I also wanted to learn React Native (✨Whoow✨ 🎊🎉)!

## How to run the source code?

Firstly, make sure both Node.js and NPM are installed.

1. Install the dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the app 🚀
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

Now you can run the app with your preferred method. Android, iOS, Web, whatever :).

NOTE: The app has only been tested on Android, 
so I'm not sure if it will work on other platforms.

## How to install the app on your device?

Select your release from the release section on this page 
and follow the details down below ⬇️.

### Android
I don't know! I have not done this yet 😐.
